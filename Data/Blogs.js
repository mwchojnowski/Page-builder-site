            You’ve likely seen those numbers before. Still, if you’re a new business owner who recently opened a Shopify store, that information can be daunting. After all, why bother investing all the time and money it takes to get a store up and running if it’s only going to last a couple years? 
            
            Ideally, you’ll be able to quickly turn a profit and then generate enough income to support yourself for as long as you need it. But you’ll need a plan in place to get the results you want.
            
            What you do in your first 90 days of operation could very well determine whether or not your store makes it to the five-year mark and beyond. Below, we’ll show you everything you need to know about setting your Shopify store up for long-term success.`},

After your first few months in business, you’ll need to keep checking in to ensure that your actions are having their intended effect.

            For example, if your abandoned checkout emails aren’t actually reducing your cart abandonment rate, you should try rewriting your email copy or using a third-party app instead of the built-in Shopify feature. The most successful ecommerce merchants never stop looking for new ways to improve their store’s performance.
            
            With the help of these tips and a little bit of luck, you can look forward to many years of Shopify success.`}]

Then, we went over techniques that stores can use to adapt to the pandemic, such as introducing a subscription pricing model and creating digital experiences.

            Various types of online stores were impacted by COVID-19 in different ways. “How Off-Price Retailers are Approaching Ecommerce During COVID-19” addressed how the pandemic affected off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls. And in “How Online Clothing Resellers are Surviving — and Even Thriving — During Quarantine,” we took a look at how the online resale community responded to the novel coronavirus. 
            
            While there’s no doubt the pandemic has been bad for the economy as a whole, sales of some products actually went up during this time.
            
            In “8 Profitable Ecommerce Niches for 2020,” we covered these trends in detail. Unsurprisingly, the skyrocketing sales figures for most of these products is the direct result of social distancing and lockdown orders — the list includes work-from-home equipment, home gym equipment, gardening supplies and more. `},

And if you’re new to ecommerce, the section on which factors to consider when choosing a supplier should be quite useful to you. 
            
            In “What is a SKU? And 10 Plugins to Help You Generate Them,” we show you which SKU generator tools stand out as the best. Here’s the answer to the first part of that title — SKU stands for “store keeping unit.” Assigning a SKU to each of your products makes it much easier to keep track of your inventory, but manually creating SKUs is a tedious, mistake-prone process. With a SKU generator plugin, you’ll be able to save a lot of time and avoid data entry errors. 
            
            And in “The Top 8 Order Fulfillment Companies & Benefits of Each,” we review the pros and cons of several popular order fulfillment companies. As with many other decisions regarding ecommerce, the best solution for one business isn’t necessarily the best for another. In this post, we discuss options for low- and high-volume stores, and include top companies, such as Rakuten Super Logistics and ShipBob. `}]

            Merchants use pop-ups on their store because they’re effective: On average, pop-ups have a conversion rate of about 3.1% and the highest performing ones have a conversion rate of 9.28%. 
            
            But, you must understand the intent of the audience before placing a pop-up on your page. And you shouldn’t use them across your entire site. 
            
            For example, a visitor on your payment page already has an intent to buy. If you place an opt-in here, there’s a possibility you'll annoy the visitor and they'll leave the page altogether. It ruins the buying experience and does more harm than good.
            
            Instead, include an opt-in on your home page, ‘About’ page, product pages, blog and other educational landing pages.`}]

            They’re pages specifically created for a particular purpose — for example, to collect emails for your store newsletter or product watchlist — and thus, play a major role in any sales funnel. 
            
            These pages help you attract targeted traffic. And you can use this traffic to get (potential) customers to take inspired action.
            
            That said, landing pages are only effective if you’re able to drive this tailored traffic to them.
            
            For this, you need to leverage various marketing methods such as email marketing and social media marketing. Search engine optimization (SEO) is an effective organic marketing tool available to you, too.
            
            SEO is a set of optimization techniques that you can use to not only improve your user experience but also help your website rank higher in the search engine results pages (SERPs). When your website ranks higher in the search results for the right queries, you’ll get highly-targeted traffic.

            Keywords are essentially search terms that people use to find things on Google. By incorporating relevant keywords into your landing page copy, you’ll tell the search engines what your landing page is all about. 
            
            So, how can you find the right keywords for your landing page?
            
            To find relevant keywords for your landing pages, you need to conduct keyword research. You can use tools such as SEMrush and Google Keyword Planner for this project. All you have to do is enter a primary keyword and the tool will come up with a list of relevant keywords. From there, you should choose the ones that are the right fit for your brand.
            
            Once you have your keywords, you need to start adding them to your landing page copy naturally. Remember, stuffing keywords into your copy can hurt you on the SERPs (think: a Google penalty that will ding your search position). Working them in naturally will help your SEO and help you maintain the quality of your copy.
            
            Apart from the landing page copy, you should also add them to the page title, URL and meta description. Doing so can also positively impact your SEO.`}]

You’ll be able to inform shoppers of how many products you have in stock (if you choose to list the number with the product), and save your customer support team from constant back and forth communications with consumers. Within this plan, you can also calculate your economic order quantity (EOQ) to map out your supply chain operations accordingly.`}]
